# Movies Recommendation System
Recommend movies based on few inputs provided by user.

## Introduction

With the rapid explosion of entertainment creation and the outburst of video streaming platforms on the Internet, the catalog of movies is rapidly expanding, which makes users overwhelmed with a lot of movies to select for watching. Movie Recommendation Systems come into play, which take users’ preferences into account, and recommend movies to users. This helps users to save a great deal of effort and time, which is wasted when a movie is searched manually. This motivated me to start research on the topic ‘Movie Recommendation’.
