## Introduction

With the rapid explosion of video streaming platforms on the Internet, the catalog of movies is rising exponentially, leaving viewers overwhelmed with a huge database of movies to choose from. Movie Recommendation Systems come into play, which consider users' preferences and recommend movies to them. This saves users a lot of time and effort that would otherwise be wasted while searching for a movie manually. This motivated me to start research on the topic ‘Movies Recommendation’.
